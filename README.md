# Apollo Cache Helper

This was a quick project (that's no longer needed as Apollo Gallery has migrated to CF Workers) that allowed for dynamic updates of static CF pages deployments.
It was what updated the slider, and published future albums.

Used the [WorkerLogsToDiscord](https://github.com/socksthewolf/workerlogstodiscord) project to feed updates.

It is no longer needed, and is now archived. No further updates will be taken.
